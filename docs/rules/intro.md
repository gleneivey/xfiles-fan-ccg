Game Introduction
=================

The _X-Files Fan CCG_ is:
* a card game:  Two players draw and play cards, one wins.
* a deck-building game:  There will be a large set of available cards, and each player assembles their deck independently from them.
* themed based on "The X-Files":  Card illustrations are from, and names and game mechanics inspired by, the television show _The X-Files_.
* _not_ endorsed by or associated with "The X-Files":  _The X-Files_ is Trademark and Copyright by the Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, which has not licensed this project.
* _non-commercial_:  The game is being designed and created by and for fans of _The X-Files_, with rules and cards being (solely) distributed through this website for free.
* designed as a collectible card game:  It isn't truly collectible, as the download-and-print-your-own distribution doesn't limit card availability or impose rarity.  However, it is designed to meet the conventions of a collectible card game and could be distributed in increments of "decks" and (randomized) "booster packs" of cards.
